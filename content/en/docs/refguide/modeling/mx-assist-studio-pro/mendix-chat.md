MendixChat is a built-in chat interface powered by Generative AI in Studio Pro. Developers can ask questions about app development in Mendix, including how to apply concepts, best practices, and development patterns. 

MendixChat is built based on large language models (LLMs), using data from [Mendix Docs](https://docs.mendix.com/), [Mendix Community](https://community.mendix.com/), and [Mendix Academy](https://academy.mendix.com/).

## 3 Keyboard Support

You can use the following shortcut keys in MendixChat, including on the feedback page:

| Key | Description |
| --- | --- |
| <kbd>Enter</kbd> or <kbd>Ctrl</kbd> + <kbd>Enter</kbd> | Send your question in the chat. |
| <kbd>Shift</kbd> + <kbd>Enter</kbd> | Add a new line to your question. |

## 4 Limitation 

You can ask questions that are related to the Mendix domain knowledge. However, only limited questions can be answered at this moment. If your question cannot be answered, you will get a default reply that asks you to provide another question.

Currently, MendixChat cannot make changes to your project, automate tasks, or create elements, components, documents, or models. In upcoming releases, these functionalities will be added to MendixChat or as separate features.
