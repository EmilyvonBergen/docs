## 1 Introduction

When you have created your app, it is important to be able to manage it. There are several pages in the Developer Portal that allow you to look at the app's performance and to ensure that data is backed up and can be restored under your control.

Access to operations information is divided into four pages: Metrics, Alerts, Logs, and Backups.

This page describes the operations pages for apps deployed to Mendix Cloud. If your app is deployed to SAP Business Technology Platform (SAP BTP) instead, the **Metrics**, **Alerts**, **Logs**, and **Backups** pages in the Developer Portal link to the SAP BTP cockpit.
